     <h3>About Me</h3>
     <p>I have recently begun my journey to become a junior software developer. Whilst my degree is in fashion design, I have always enjoyed being creative and problem solving. Whilst studying I ended up working with young people at risk of CSE for well over 10 years. Within this role you are regularly faced with challenges and issues which you have to solve in order to safeguard young people at risk from harm.</p>
     <p>I have toyed with the idea of learning code for over a year, and discovered a Youtube video of a female software developer. There she spoke about the lack of females in the industry and how she did a career change to become a software developer. This led me to self teach on various platforms online at home, particularly in the pandemic to see if I understood and liked coding. I then researched for a year and discovered Manchester codes to begin my career in software developing.</p>
